# Crypto Dash

A simple dashboard UI and app that works in tandem with the Coin Gecko API to draw and display cryptocurrency data. The home page displays by default the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The user can change the number of coins to 5, 20, and 50 by using the relevant limit selector. The displayed coins can be sorted according to different metrics by referring to the sort selector. Furthermore, the displayed coins can be filtered by name or shorthand in real time through the filter input. By clicking each displayed coin the app reroutes to an individual page for each coin that contains additional information and metrics, plus a graph of coin price for the last week.

Built with:

- React and vanilla JavaScript
- React Router in declarative mode for routing operations
- React Spinners for the utilization and customization of pre-made loaders
- ChartJS for coin price graphs
